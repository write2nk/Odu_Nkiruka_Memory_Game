# Odu_Nkiruka_Memory_Game
This is the second project for the Nano degree front-end developer
Below are the basic functionalities of the game "Memory Game"
The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It  also tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was
The restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
The modal contains 2 buttons "cancel" and "replay"
The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it changes to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it changes to an even lower star rating (down to 1).
It also displays the current number of moves a user has made and the time it took the user to complete the game
